## üöÄ How to Use These Resources

1. **Read the Fusion+ whitepaper** to understand cross-chain escrow design, Merkle-tree secret architecture, and recovery logic.
2. **Review MixBytes article** for architectural context: how LOP forms the foundation, how Dutch auctions and cross-chain logic extend it.
3. **Explore official Help Center articles** (Fusion and Fusion+) for protocol flow, resolver mechanics, presets, and guided phases.
4. **Study the blog posts** (1inch and Blockworks) for high-level design rationale, security measures, and UX guidelines.
5. **Use Developer Portal & API docs** on Fusion+ to connect code-level order creation, quote fetching, and secret submission flows ([1inch Developer Portal][9], [MixBytes][7], [1inch Blog][3]).
