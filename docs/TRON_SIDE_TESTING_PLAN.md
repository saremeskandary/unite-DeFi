## ✅ **TRON-Side Testing Checklist**

### 🧱 1. HTLC Smart Contract Logic

- ✅ Hashlock: Validate SHA256 hash of the preimage in TRON smart contract
- ✅ Timelock: Correct `block.timestamp` validation in contract
- ✅ Dual paths: Ensure both redemption path (with secret) and refund path (after timeout) work
- ✅ Compatible with TRON wallet formats (TronLink, etc.)

---

### 🏗️ 2. Smart Contract Deployment

- ✅ Deploy and validate HTLC smart contract on TRON Testnet (Nile)
- ✅ Match contract address with TRON address format (T...)
- ✅ Compatible with TRON's TVM (Tron Virtual Machine)

---

### 💰 3. Funding the HTLC

- ✅ Fund HTLC contract on TRON Testnet with TRX
- ✅ Verify broadcast and confirmation of transaction
- ✅ Track funding transaction (txid) for spend later

---

### 🔐 4. Redeeming with Preimage

- ✅ Build and sign TRON transaction that:

  - Calls the HTLC contract with the secret + recipient address
  - Uses proper message format and energy limits

- ✅ Validate it gets accepted by validators and confirmed
- ✅ Reveal the secret in a visible, parsable way

---

### 🔁 5. Refund Flow (Timelock Expiry)

- ✅ Confirm refund **only possible after** `block.timestamp`
- ✅ Refund transaction is correctly built and signed
- ✅ Verify timelock enforcement by TRON validators
- ✅ Confirm refund TRX appears in the sender's wallet

---

### 👁️ 6. Secret Extraction Monitoring

- ✅ Monitor mempool and blockchain for HTLC redemption
- ✅ Extract secret (preimage) from transaction message
- ✅ Trigger Ethereum-side swap completion using this secret

---

### 📦 7. TRON Lifecycle & Fee Management

- ✅ Track and update wallet balances (funding, spending)
- ✅ Proper energy estimation for redeem/refund
- ✅ Replace-by-Fee (RBF) support if refund gets stuck

---

### 🔒 8. Security & Edge Cases

- ✅ Reject redemption with wrong secret
- ✅ Prevent early refunds
- ✅ Reject double-spend attempts
- ✅ Test dust threshold (min TRX amount)
- ✅ Confirm contracts are replay-safe and chain-specific (e.g., Testnet vs Mainnet)

---

### 🧪 9. Negative / Adversarial Testing (Advanced)

- ❌ Use malformed contract (simulate dev error)
- ❌ Broadcast transaction with wrong energy limit
- ❌ Attempt secret reuse across chains
- ❌ Use expired secret (too late for Ethereum claim)
- ❌ Simulate network latency between chains

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Plan for 1inch Fusion+ TRON Atomic Swaps

This plan ensures your implementation is secure, resilient, and fully integrated, covering not just the TRON HTLC mechanics but the entire swap lifecycle, including the resolver's role and potential failure modes.

### 1. Core TRON HTLC Mechanics

This section refines and combines your previous tests for the fundamental TRON-side operations.

| ID           | Category                 | Test Case                                                                                              | Expected Outcome                                                                           |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TRON-CORE-01 | **HTLC Contract**        | Deploy a smart contract with a known secret hash and timelock.                                         | The deployed contract logic is correct and the address is valid on TRON Testnet (Nile).    |
| TRON-CORE-02 | **Funding**              | Send testnet TRX to the deployed HTLC contract.                                                        | The funding transaction confirms and the balance is visible and tied to the HTLC contract. |
| TRON-CORE-03 | **Happy Path: Redeem**   | Build and broadcast a transaction calling the HTLC contract using the correct secret preimage.         | The transaction is accepted and confirmed. The TRX is sent to the receiver's address.      |
| TRON-CORE-04 | **Unhappy Path: Refund** | Attempt to broadcast a refund transaction _before_ the timelock expires.                               | The transaction is rejected by TRON validators (`invalid timestamp`).                      |
| TRON-CORE-05 | **Happy Path: Refund**   | Broadcast a refund transaction _after_ the timelock expires.                                           | The transaction is accepted and confirmed. The TRX is returned to the original funder.     |
| TRON-CORE-06 | **Monitoring**           | The resolver's monitoring service successfully parses the redeem transaction from the mempool/a block. | The correct secret preimage is extracted and passed to the Ethereum-side logic.            |

### 2. End-to-End Swap Scenarios (Crucial Addition)

This is the most important new section. It tests the **full, integrated workflow** from the user's perspective, ensuring all components (UI, 1inch API, Resolver, ETH Contracts, TRON Contracts) work together.

#### 🔄 **Scenario A: User Swaps ERC20 for Native TRX**

1.  **User Action:** User creates a Fusion order to swap 1 WBTC for native TRX.
2.  **Resolver Action:**
    - Wins the auction on the 1inch network.
    - Locks the corresponding amount of native TRX in an HTLC contract on TRON Testnet.
3.  **User Action:**
    - The UI detects the TRON-side lock.
    - User's wallet/client reveals the secret to the Ethereum contract to claim the locked TRX (conceptually, by initiating the claim which releases the secret).
4.  **Resolver Action:**
    - Detects the secret revealed on the Ethereum chain.
    - Uses the secret to claim the user's WBTC from the Fusion contract.
5.  **✅ Expected Outcome:** The user receives native TRX, the resolver receives WBTC, and the swap is complete.

#### 🔄 **Scenario B: User Swaps Native TRX for ERC20**

1.  **User Action:** User creates a Fusion order and locks native TRX in an HTLC contract on TRON Testnet. The `secretHash` is provided to the 1inch order.
2.  **Resolver Action:**
    - Wins the auction.
    - Detects the funded HTLC on the TRON chain.
    - Fills the Fusion order, sending the corresponding ERC20 to the user's Ethereum address. This action **reveals the secret** on the Ethereum chain.
3.  **User Action:**
    - Detects the secret from the resolver's transaction on Ethereum.
    - Uses the secret to redeem the locked native TRX on the TRON chain.
4.  **✅ Expected Outcome:** The user receives ERC20 and redeems their original TRX. The resolver has successfully facilitated the swap.

### 3. Resolver Logic & Resilience Testing (New Section)

This tests the "brain" of your resolver to ensure it's profitable, fast, and robust.

| ID           | Category              | Test Case                                                                            | Expected Outcome                                                                                        |
| :----------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| RES-LOGIC-01 | **Profitability**     | Simulate an auction with high TRON network fees.                                     | The resolver should calculate a negative profit and **not** bid on the order.                           |
| RES-LOGIC-02 | **Auction Bidding**   | A new, attractive order appears in the 1inch WebSocket feed.                         | The resolver correctly analyzes the order and submits a competitive bid within seconds.                 |
| RES-FAIL-01  | **TRON Node Failure** | The resolver's primary TRON node connection drops while waiting for an HTLC to fund. | The resolver seamlessly fails over to a backup node (e.g., a public TRON API) and continues monitoring. |
| RES-FAIL-02  | **Stuck TX**          | A TRON redeem/refund transaction is broadcast with an energy limit that is too low.  | The resolver correctly uses energy bumping to ensure the transaction is mined.                          |

---

### 4. Security & Adversarial Testing (Expanded)

This section expands on edge cases to ensure the system is secure against malicious actors or critical errors.

| ID         | Category             | Test Case                                                                                                                               | Expected Outcome                                                                                                                   |
| :--------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEC-ADV-01 | **Invalid Secret**   | A malicious user tries to redeem the TRON HTLC with an incorrect secret.                                                                | The TRON transaction is invalid and rejected.                                                                                      |
| SEC-ADV-02 | **Secret Re-use**    | A resolver tries to use an old secret from a previous swap to claim funds.                                                              | The `secretHash` won't match the current swap's hash, so the claim will fail on both chains.                                       |
| SEC-ADV-03 | **Refund Race**      | The user fails to redeem in time. As soon as the timelock expires, both the user (redeem) and resolver (refund) broadcast transactions. | Only the valid transaction (the refund) should be confirmed. The system must handle the race condition gracefully.                 |
| SEC-ADV-04 | **ETH-Side Failure** | The resolver's `completeFusionSwap` call on Ethereum fails (e.g., runs out of gas).                                                     | The resolver should have a retry mechanism. The user's funds on the TRON side remain safe and become refundable after the timeout. |
