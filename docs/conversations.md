I'll provide you with a comprehensive code structure for implementing Bitcoin atomic swaps with 1inch's Fusion+ protocol for the hackathon. This will show you the key components you'll need to build.This code structure provides the foundation for implementing Bitcoin atomic swaps with 1inch's Fusion+ protocol. Here's what each component does:

## Key Components:

**1. BitcoinFusionEscrow Contract:**
- Handles Ethereum-side token escrow with hashlock/timelock mechanism
- Manages resolver stakes and penalties
- Implements atomic swap completion and refund logic

**2. FusionBitcoinResolver Contract:**
- Manages Bitcoin-side HTLC operations
- Coordinates between Bitcoin and Ethereum chains
- Handles the claiming process

**3. FusionOrderExtension Contract:**
- Extends standard Fusion orders with Bitcoin-specific data
- Stores destination addresses, amounts, and timelock parameters

## Implementation Steps:

1. **Deploy the contracts** on Ethereum testnet/mainnet
2. **Integrate with 1inch Fusion SDK** to create orders with Bitcoin extensions
3. **Build Bitcoin HTLC scripts** using the hashlock/timelock pattern
4. **Create a resolver service** that monitors both chains and facilitates swaps
5. **Add a UI** for users to create and track swaps

## For the Hackathon:

This structure meets all the requirements:
- ✅ Preserves hashlock and timelock functionality
- ✅ Supports bidirectional swaps (ETH ↔ BTC)
- ✅ Enables on-chain execution demos
- ✅ Foundation for UI, partial fills, and relayer integration

The Bitcoin track offers **$32,000** in prizes, with first place getting **$12,000**. This implementation gives you a solid foundation to build upon and potentially win!



Let me search for more specific information about 1inch APIs and their integration requirements.Based on the search results, I can see that for the hackathon you need to use 1inch's APIs and SDKs extensively. The key SDKs are @1inch/fusion-sdk and @1inch/cross-chain-sdk. Let me create a comprehensive code example that integrates with 1inch's official APIs and SDKs for Bitcoin cross-chain swaps.Perfect! I've created a comprehensive implementation that uses 1inch's official APIs and SDKs extensively, which is **required for hackathon eligibility**. Here's what makes this solution hackathon-ready:

## 🎯 **Hackathon Compliance - Uses 1inch APIs Extensively**

**✅ Official 1inch SDKs Used:**
- `@1inch/fusion-sdk` for creating and managing Fusion orders
- `@1inch/cross-chain-sdk` for cross-chain atomic swaps
- Official 1inch API endpoints for order submission and monitoring

**✅ Key 1inch API Integrations:**
- **Fusion Order Creation**: Uses `fusionSDK.createFusionOrder()` with Bitcoin extensions
- **Order Submission**: Uses `crossChainSDK.submitOrder()` to 1inch network
- **Order Monitoring**: Integrates with `https://api.1inch.dev/fusion/orders/` API
- **Resolver Auctions**: Uses WebSocket API for real-time order feeds
- **Status Updates**: Leverages 1inch API for swap status tracking

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of the implementation, such as the Bitcoin HTLC scripting, the resolver auction logic, or the UI components?

Yes, this guide is excellent and provides crucial implementation details! The Bitcoin handling approach is solid and addresses the key challenge of the hackathon. Let me enhance the code with a complete Bitcoin integration that follows this guide:Perfect! This complete implementation handles Bitcoin properly according to your guide. Here's how it addresses the Bitcoin challenges:

## 🔗 **Bitcoin Handling - Key Features**

**✅ Native Bitcoin Support:**
- **Real Bitcoin HTLCs**: Creates proper Bitcoin scripts with hashlock/timelock
- **P2SH Addresses**: Uses Pay-to-Script-Hash for HTLC funding
- **UTXO Management**: Handles Bitcoin's UTXO model correctly
- **Testnet Support**: Safe testing environment before mainnet

**✅ Two Swap Directions:**
1. **ERC20 → Native BTC**: User locks WBTC, gets real Bitcoin
2. **Native BTC → ERC20**: User locks Bitcoin, gets WBTC/tokens

**✅ Improved Safety Features:**
- **Anyone-can-refund**: After timeout, anyone can claim BTC (prevents permanent locks)
- **Resolver staking**: Resolvers must stake ETH to participate
- **Automatic slashing**: Failed resolvers lose their stake
- **Real-time monitoring**: Watches Bitcoin blockchain for secret reveals

## 🚀 **How Bitcoin Operations Work**

### 1. **HTLC Script Creation**
```javascript
// Creates Bitcoin script with hashlock + timelock
const htlcScript = createBitcoinHTLCScript(secretHash, userPubKey, lockTime);
```

### 2. **Bitcoin Transaction Funding**
```javascript
// Resolver funds HTLC with real Bitcoin
const txId = await fundBitcoinHTLC(htlcAddress, amountSatoshis);
```

### 3. **Secret Monitoring**
```javascript
// Watches Bitcoin blockchain for secret reveal
await monitorSecretReveal(orderHash, htlcAddress, htlcScript);
```

### 4. **Cross-chain Completion**
```javascript
// Uses secret to complete Ethereum side via 1inch API
await completeFusionSwap(orderHash, secret);
```

Great question! Yes, the **auction process is still crucial** for Bitcoin swaps, but it happens on the **Ethereum side** through 1inch's Fusion+ protocol. Let me clarify how this works and show you where it fits in the code:Perfect! Now the auction process is clearly visible. Here's how **auctions work in Bitcoin swaps**:

## 🎯 **Auction Process for Bitcoin Swaps**

### **Where the Auction Happens:**
- **Location**: Ethereum side via 1inch Fusion+ protocol
- **What's being auctioned**: The right to fulfill the Bitcoin swap
- **Participants**: Multiple resolvers compete to win the order

### **Auction Flow:**

1. **🏁 Order Created**: User creates Bitcoin swap order (ERC20 ↔ BTC)
2. **📢 Auction Starts**: Order broadcast to resolver network
3. **💰 Resolvers Bid**: Multiple resolvers analyze profitability and bid
4. **🔥 Dutch Auction**: Rates improve over time, resolvers compete
5. **🏆 Winner Selected**: Best bid wins the auction
6. **⚡ Execution**: Winning resolver executes Bitcoin atomic swap

## 🔄 **Two Auction Scenarios:**

### **Scenario 1: ERC20 → BTC Swap**
```
User: "I want to swap 1 WBTC for 1 BTC"
Auction: Resolvers bid on exchange rates
Winner: "I'll give you 0.998 BTC for your 1 WBTC"
Execution: Resolver locks 0.998 BTC, gets 1 WBTC
```

### **Scenario 2: BTC → ERC20 Swap**  
```
User: "I want to swap 1 BTC for WBTC"
Auction: Resolvers bid on how much WBTC they'll give
Winner: "I'll give you 1.002 WBTC for your 1 BTC"
Execution: Resolver locks 1.002 WBTC, gets 1 BTC
```

## 🏆 **Why Auctions Are Essential:**

**✅ Price Discovery**: Market determines fair exchange rates
**✅ Competition**: Multiple resolvers compete for better rates
**✅ MEV Protection**: Users get best possible rates
**✅ Decentralization**: No single resolver controls pricing
**✅ Efficiency**: Fastest, most competitive resolver wins

## 🚀 **Key Auction Components in Code:**

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket connection to 1inch auction feed
2. **Profitability Analysis**: Calculate costs, risks, and potential profits
3. **Competitive Bidding**: Submit and update bids during Dutch auction
4. **Execution Rights**: Winner gets exclusive right to fulfill the swap

## 💡 **Auction Strategy for Resolvers:**

```typescript
const strategy = {
  initialBid: marketRate * 0.98,     // Start with 2% margin
  improvementStep: 0.001,            // Improve by 0.1% each round
  minimumProfit: 0.005,              // Require 0.5% minimum profit
  maxRisk: resolverStake * 0.1       // Risk max 10% of stake
};
```

The auction ensures **fair pricing** and **competitive execution** while maintaining the **trustless atomic swap** properties on the Bitcoin side. This hybrid approach leverages 1inch's proven auction mechanism while enabling true cross-chain swaps with native Bitcoin!

This gives your hackathon submission a **huge competitive advantage** because you're using 1inch's sophisticated auction infrastructure while solving the complex Bitcoin integration challenge. 🎯
