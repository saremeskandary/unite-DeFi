# Bitcoin Transaction Signing Guide

## Overview

This document explains how users can manually sign Bitcoin transactions for HTLC swaps in the Unite DeFi application. Since Bitcoin doesn't support direct wallet connections like MetaMask, users need to manually sign and broadcast transactions using their Bitcoin wallets.

## Why Manual Transaction Signing?

### Bitcoin's Limitations

- **No Smart Contracts**: Bitcoin's scripting language is limited
- **No Direct Wallet Connection**: Cannot connect Bitcoin wallets like MetaMask
- **Manual Transaction Signing**: Users must manually sign transactions
- **Off-chain Coordination**: Requires careful coordination between chains

### HTLC Requirements

- **Trustless Execution**: HTLCs require specific transaction structures
- **Custom Scripts**: Bitcoin scripts must be precisely crafted
- **Time Locks**: Transactions must include specific time constraints
- **Secret Verification**: Cryptographic secrets must be properly handled

## Transaction Types

### 1. HTLC Funding Transaction

**Purpose**: Creates the HTLC by sending Bitcoin to a special address

**When Used**:

- BTC â†’ ERC20 swaps
- User wants to send Bitcoin to receive ERC20 tokens

**Key Components**:

- **Inputs**: User's Bitcoin UTXOs
- **Outputs**: HTLC address (main output) + change address
- **Script**: HTLC script with secret hash and time lock
- **Lock Time**: Prevents refund until time expires

### 2. HTLC Spending Transaction

**Purpose**: Claims Bitcoin from HTLC by revealing the secret

**When Used**:

- After ERC20 tokens are received
- User wants to claim their Bitcoin

**Key Components**:

- **Input**: HTLC output
- **Output**: User's Bitcoin address
- **Witness Data**: Secret and signature
- **Script**: HTLC script verification

3. Verify the transaction details match expectations

### Step 2: Import to Bitcoin Wallet

1. Open your Bitcoin wallet (Electrum, Bitcoin Core, etc.)
2. Navigate to "Sign Transaction" or "Advanced" section
3. Paste the transaction hex
4. Review transaction details carefully

### Step 3: Sign Transaction

1. Verify all inputs and outputs
2. Check fee amount is reasonable
3. Confirm HTLC address is correct
4. Sign with your private key
5. Review the signed transaction

### Step 4: Broadcast Transaction

1. Copy the signed transaction hex
2. Use wallet's "Broadcast" function
3. Or use a Bitcoin block explorer
4. Wait for confirmation (1-6 blocks)

## Supported Bitcoin Wallets

## Security Considerations

### Before Signing

- âœ… Verify HTLC address is correct
- âœ… Check time lock duration
- âœ… Confirm fee amount
- âœ… Review all inputs and outputs
- âœ… Ensure secret hash matches

### During Signing

- ðŸ”’ Use secure, offline wallet if possible
- ðŸ”’ Never share private keys
- ðŸ”’ Double-check transaction details
- ðŸ”’ Verify wallet is not compromised

### After Broadcasting

- ðŸ“¡ Monitor transaction confirmation
- ðŸ“¡ Keep secret safe for claiming
- ðŸ“¡ Track HTLC status
- ðŸ“¡ Monitor for secret reveal

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Transaction Rejection

**Problem**: Transaction fails to broadcast
**Solutions**:

- Check fee is sufficient
- Verify inputs are unspent
- Ensure proper script format
- Check network congestion

### Incorrect HTLC Address

**Problem**: Funds sent to wrong address
**Solutions**:

- Double-check address before signing
- Verify secret hash matches
- Confirm time lock settings
- Use testnet for testing

### Time Lock Issues

**Problem**: Cannot claim funds after time lock
**Solutions**:

- Monitor time lock expiration
- Have backup claiming method
- Understand refund process
- Plan timing carefully

## Testing on Testnet

### Testnet Benefits
