## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Set up test environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   ```

### Running All Wallet Tests

Use the provided test runner script:

```bash
./tests/integration/wallet/run-wallet-tests.sh
```

### Running Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Core wallet integration tests
pnpm test tests/integration/wallet/wallet-integration.test.ts

# Component tests
pnpm test tests/integration/wallet/wallet-component.test.tsx

# End-to-end tests
pnpm test tests/integration/wallet/wallet-e2e.test.ts
```

### Running Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Test only connection flows
pnpm test --testNamePattern="Wallet Connection Flows"

# Test only balance fetching
pnpm test --testNamePattern="Balance Fetching"

# Test only transaction signing
pnpm test --testNamePattern="Transaction Signing"

# Test only multi-chain support
pnpm test --testNamePattern="Multi-Chain Support"

# Test only error handling
pnpm test --testNamePattern="Error Handling for Wallet Failures"
```

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables

The tests use the following environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV=test` - Sets the environment to test mode
- `TEST_WALLET_INTEGRATION=true` - Enables wallet integration tests
- `JEST_TIMEOUT=30000` - Sets test timeout to 30 seconds for blockchain operations

### Mock Configuration

The tests use comprehensive mocking to simulate:

- **Window.ethereum** - MetaMask and other wallet providers
- **Ethers.js** - Blockchain interactions
- **Clipboard API** - Address copying functionality
- **Toast notifications** - User feedback
- **Network requests** - RPC calls and API interactions

### Test Data

The tests use realistic test data including:

- Valid Ethereum addresses
- Realistic token balances
- Common ERC-20 tokens (USDC, WETH, DAI, etc.)
- Multiple network configurations
- Various error scenarios

## Test Coverage

The wallet integration tests provide comprehensive coverage of:

### Core Functionality

- âœ… Wallet connection and disconnection
- âœ… Balance fetching and display
- âœ… Transaction signing and validation
- âœ… Multi-chain support and switching
- âœ… Error handling and recovery

### User Experience

- âœ… UI state management

## Expected Test Results

### Successful Test Run

When all tests pass, you should see output similar to:

```
ðŸš€ Starting Wallet Integration Tests...
=====================================

ðŸ“‹ Running wallet integration tests...
PASS tests/integration/wallet/wallet-integration.test.ts
PASS tests/integration/wallet/wallet-component.test.tsx
PASS tests/integration/wallet/wallet-e2e.test.ts

âœ… Wallet Integration Tests Completed!
ðŸŽ‰ All wallet integration tests passed!
```

### Coverage Report

The tests generate a coverage report showing:

- **Statements**: Percentage of code statements executed
- **Branches**: Percentage of conditional branches tested
- **Functions**: Percentage of functions called
- **Lines**: Percentage of lines executed

### Test Results

Detailed test results are saved to:

- `coverage/wallet-integration/test-results.json` - JSON format test results
- `coverage/wallet-integration/lcov-report/` - HTML coverage report

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeout Errors**

   - Increase `JEST_TIMEOUT` in jest.config.ts
   - Check network connectivity for blockchain operations

2. **Mock Configuration Errors**

   - Ensure all mocks are properly configured
   - Check that window.ethereum is properly mocked

3. **Environment Variable Issues**

   - Verify .env.test file exists and is properly configured
   - Check that NODE_ENV is set to 'test'

4. **Dependency Issues**
   - Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall if necessary

### Debug Mode

To run tests in debug mode with more verbose output:

```bash
pnpm test --verbose --detectOpenHandles tests/integration/wallet/
```

### Individual Test Debugging

To debug a specific test:

```bash
pnpm test --testNamePattern="should connect to MetaMask successfully" --verbose
```

## Contributing

When adding new wallet integration tests:

1. **Follow the existing test structure** - Use the established patterns and naming conventions
2. **Add comprehensive mocking** - Ensure all external dependencies are properly mocked
3. **Test both success and failure scenarios** - Cover edge cases and error conditions
4. **Update this documentation** - Document new test categories and scenarios
5. **Maintain test coverage** - Ensure new functionality is adequately tested

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

- **GitHub Actions**: Tests run on every pull request
- **Coverage Reporting**: Results are published to coverage services
- **Failure Reporting**: Detailed error messages for debugging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Test execution time tracking
