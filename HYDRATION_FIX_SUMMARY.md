# Hydration Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing hydration errors with the following error message:

```
A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties.
```

The specific attributes causing issues were:

- `ontouchstart=""`
- `style={{top:"auto"}}`

These attributes were being added to the `body` element during client-side rendering but not during server-side rendering, causing a mismatch.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **PWA Configuration**: The Progressive Web App setup was adding mobile-specific attributes to the body element
2. **Client-side Mounting**: Components using `useState` and `useEffect` for mounting checks were causing hydration mismatches
3. **Service Worker Registration**: The service worker registration was happening immediately on client load
4. **Touch Action CSS**: The `touch-action: manipulation` CSS property was being applied inconsistently

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Layout Component (`src/app/layout.tsx`)

- Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to the body element to prevent hydration warnings for known safe mismatches
- This allows the PWA attributes to be added without causing errors

### 2. Swap Interface Client (`src/components/swap/swap-interface-client.tsx`)

- Added a loading state during hydration to prevent content mismatch
- Improved the mounting check to show a skeleton loader until the component is fully mounted

### 3. Service Worker Registration (`src/components/pwa/service-worker-register.tsx`)

- Added hydration state tracking to ensure service worker registration only happens after hydration is complete
- Added a small delay to ensure DOM is fully ready before registration

### 4. Global CSS (`src/app/globals.css`)

- Commented out `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent hydration issues
- Added comments explaining the changes

### 5. Client-Only Wrapper (`src/components/providers/client-only.tsx`)

- Created a new `ClientOnly` component that ensures components only render on the client side
- Provides fallback UI during server-side rendering

### 6. Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)

- Wrapped components that might cause hydration issues with `ClientOnly`
- Added skeleton loaders as fallbacks for better UX

### 7. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)

- Added `optimizePackageImports` for `@tonconnect/ui-react` to improve package loading
- This helps prevent hydration issues related to external package loading

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Consistent Rendering**: Ensured server and client render the same content initially
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Components gracefully handle the transition from server to client
3. **Loading States**: Added appropriate loading states to prevent layout shifts
4. **Error Boundaries**: Maintained existing error boundaries for robust error handling

## Testing

The application should now:

- Load without hydration errors
- Display appropriate loading states during hydration
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Provide a smooth user experience
